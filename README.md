# XYZ Company Office Map
Office locator map for XYZ Company Headquarters Building Floor Nine.

## General Info
XYZ Company has many clients visit their headquarters on Floor Nine. Typically, clients would ask the receptionist for directions to their meeting and would still get lost on the floor. I created this project to help direct visitors to their destination on the floor. This page allows them to search for an employee's name or conference room. Once a name is searched, that specific room is highlighted on the map. This software automates the process of finding a particular room on this floor. XYZ Company has installed it at a few touch-screen monitors at the entrance of the floor and has reported that it has eliminated the need for visitors to ask others for directions.
